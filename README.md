## A. Overview 
In this project I'm doing a Sentiment Anlysis to 7 big tech companies' news (Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Cisco, Google, Amazon, and Tesla). For the data itself I'm doing a web scrapping  from [Finviz](https://finviz.com/) using [Beautiful Soup](https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest), columns that I scrapped were Ticker, Date, Time, and Title, for further information you can read from my code [here](https://github.com/Samuel-the-crack/Stock-News-Sentiment-Analysis/blob/main/WebScrapping.py). After scrapped the data I'M doing the analysis on Jupyter Notebook.

***Requirements : Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Beautifulsoup, Vader, and Word Cloud***
